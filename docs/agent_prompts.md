# Advanced Agent Prompts

## Genspark
- Detect node structure with detailed shoot and leaf features.
- Increase robustness to varied lighting and plant angles.
- Output auxin and vigor estimates for each node.

## Manus
- Simulate growth and recovery dynamics after training actions.
- Model multi-factor vigor metrics impacting branch elongation.
- Provide daily snapshots of node health parameters.

## Minimax
- Optimize strategies across yield, canopy evenness, and stealth height.
- Use feedback from the visualizer to refine multi-objective plans.
- Support real-time adjustment suggestions during the simulation.
